## Hands-on workshop about Solid Data Pods

The repository contains the material for our CLT2023 workshop around Solid Data Pods.

We will explore the anatomy of applications using Solid Data Pods.

This workshop has been prepared for the community event: __Chemnitzer Linux-Tage__.

# Ideas for future extension

## How to dump a dataframe into a datapod?

## How to copy/move data from one pod to another?

## How to expose metadata in a pod, which becomes a "Meta-Pad"?
We can imagine, that indexed data can be exposed for other collaborators in a data pod. Many pods together could hold data which is then indexed in a central place for search, but what get added into the search corpus is controled by publishing documents into the pod. Deletion of a document leads to removal from the index. 

This means, that preindexing is done before publishing and all control regarding masking, anonymization and randomization is the publishers hand.
